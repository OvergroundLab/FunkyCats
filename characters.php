  <font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bonkie 
  is a timid newspaper journalist who works at &quot;The Daily Fuzz&quot;, a local 
  paper distributed only in his hometown, Whiskerville (H&auml;ckleholm), Sweden. 
  A good-natured fellow at heart, his morals will sometimes come at odds with 
  his career, as seedy tacticts might be required to get a hold of the next big 
  scoop! This constant struggle of balancing ethics with his job is an eternal 
  dilemma for this poor tabby. </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Generally 
    having an aversion towards excitement and adventure, Bonkie prefers the simple 
    life, but will nontheless find himself reluctantly partaking in high-flying 
    adventures, partly thanks to the assignments given to him by his boss or due 
    to the circumstances arising around the eccentric people he calls his friends 
    and family. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Having 
    severe self-esteem issues and being prone to light depressions, Bonkie's faith 
    in himself would be described as &quot;frail&quot; at best. Easily crushed 
    by setbacks, what he considers having a firm grasp on his own strengths and 
    weaknesses, is merely a weak ego making excuses. </font></p>

<div id="Layer17" style="position:absolute; left:576px; top:782px; width:601px; height:432px; z-index:50"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite 
  his short stature, this bite-sized canine can be a force to be reckoned with. 
  Being the business operator and owner of &quot;The Daily Fuzz&quot; he has the 
  ultimate say of what or what does not go to print. Going by many descriptive 
  titles such as &quot;boss&quot; or &quot;chief&quot;, he remains nameless, referred 
  to only by such formal epithets.</font> 
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He's highly 
    bipolar, showing a wide range of mood swings, in particular when dealing with 
    something that gives him a strong emotional reaction. This renders him less 
    of a team player and more of a rabid dictator, although he always has the 
    newspaper's best intentions in mind. He genuinely cares about his profession, 
    wanting to produce the best coverage in town, at any price, even going as 
    far as resorting to questionable tactics in order to accomplish this.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While 
    the relations to all his employees are at least somewhat strained thanks to 
    his emotional instability, Bonkie is the one who gets the worst end of the 
    stick. Partly because of his mild-mannered nature (ill-fitting to that of 
    a journalist according to the chief) but also because Bonkie usually has to 
    sacrifice his ethical principles in order to fulfill his duties. The chief 
    makes sure to work our feline hard so he can blossom into the kind of reporter 
    he wants to have in his employ.</font><br>
