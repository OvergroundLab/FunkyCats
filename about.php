  name is Angelo Pizarro and I like to draw comics. Like, a lot. </font> 
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This website 
    serves as an easily-navigated compendium of all the comic work I've done. 
    I've always had an online prescence in one way or another, but for reasons 
    unclear to me, not my own website for quite some time ( I used to have a site 
    on a free host that lasted for a couple of years until the provider got some 
    technical difficulties), but I've decided to ressurect my humble internet 
    abode and thus Funky Cats 2.0 was born! </font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unlike 
    most webcomics, I've adapted a more traditional approach remenicent of printed 
    comics - Comics are organized into seperate issues making it easy to pick 
    up anywhere and start reading. <br>

<div id="Layer10" style="position:absolute; left:304px; top:612px; width:863px; height:138px; z-index:45"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also, 
  unlike most webcomics, I do not focus on any single series, but a plethora of 
  them. Think of it as a variety show of sorts, having several recurring series 
  under one big umbrella. The reason for this is to keep myself motivated as it's 
  easy to get bored if if I work on one single comic for too long. A little variety 
  is always nice! But if you like a certain series more than the others, don't 
  hesitate to drop me a line and tell me! Criticism is welcome as well. Contact 
  me <a href="mailto:Ayo_1988@yahoo.se">here</a>. </font> 
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I hope 
    you'll enjoy your stay. Stay funky! </font></p>
